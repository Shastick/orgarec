Depending on your interest, you might want to only consider one of the two following parts of the project:\r\n\r\n## View\r\nThe view sub-project holds everything related to visualization: if you like plotting and drawing stuff, start here.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want to plot the data of some very specific queries, you'll have to dive into the core and write your own cute stored procedure(s).\r\n\r\n## Core\r\nThe core holds the storage, model and computation layer.\r\n\r\nIf you're only interested in raw data, want to represent study-plans or course histories for students, forget about the view and its nasty JavaScript and go directly for the core.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nThe automatically generated scaladoc can be browsed for [the core](doc/core/) and [the view](doc/view/).\r\n\r\nYou may also generate it yourself by checking out the project and running `sbt doc` to be sure to have the latest (hopefully helpful) comments.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, if you have any unresolved question, try an e-mail ! (I can't guarantee a timely reply if we are currently running around the globe...)\r\n\r\n### J. & C. -- 21.12.2012"}
