\subsection{Project Directory Structure}
We use sbt to build the code, and hence stick to its structure. Furthermore, the \verb|view|, \verb|core| and \verb|import| segments of the application each live in their own sbt sub-project.

The relevant directories are listed hereafter:

\dirtree{%
.0 .
.1 core/.
.2 src/main/scala/.
.3 ch/epfl/recom.
.4 graph/.
.4 model/.
.5 administration/.
.4 processing/.
.5 maps/.
.6 assist/.
.4 storage/.
.5 db/.
.5 maps/.
.4 util/.
.1 import/.
.2 src/main/scala/.
.3 ch/epfl/craft/recom/dimport/isa/.
